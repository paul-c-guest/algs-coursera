I benefited from reading the code of others who had done the course before me, and so in return I am making my solutions public -- in good faith.
If you are here because you are stuck on a problem, please feel free to learn from my code; but also make your best attempt to fully understand why you are stuck, without simply copying my answer. You will definitely become a better programmer from having your own eureka moments!
