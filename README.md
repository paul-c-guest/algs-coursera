A collection of my final submitted files for each project for the two courses offered by Coursera, administered by Princeton University, titled Algorithms (parts 1 and 2)

[Algorithms part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)

[Algorithms part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)

I benefited from reading the code of others who had done the course before me, and so in return I am making my solutions public -- _in good faith_.

If you are here because you are stuck on a problem, please feel free to learn from my code; but also make your best attempt to fully understand why you are stuck, without simply copying my answer. You will definitely become a better programmer from having your own eureka moments!
